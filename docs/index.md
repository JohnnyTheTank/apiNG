**apiNG** is an AngularJS directive that enables you to receive and display data from one or more sources. The data can be aggregated, limited and ordered. The complete setup is dead simple, just by adding data-attributes to your html.

There are two level of usage: _basic_ and _advanced_
* The _basic_ usage is focused on keeping it simple and easy, but with enough power for most use cases
* The _advanced_ usage turns apiNG into a plugin system for data-sources and designs, focused on re-usable modules
